Hangman game that I started with the tutorial on the Youtube channel, TechwithTim.
Expanding it, and building on it has been a great learning experience for me.
Especially in these early stages of learning python and pygame.
Some of the locals in my area has enjoyed it, so I will keep working on it and learning more
about coding. AT this stage very basic, in code and mechanics.
Looking forward to learning more about classes and inheritance with the 
next few changes that I am going to implement.
